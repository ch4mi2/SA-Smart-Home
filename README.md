# Smart Home System

The scenario involves a comprehensive smart
home automation system comprised of multiple interconnected modules that work together to automate
various aspects of the home environment.
Within this framework, certain middle-tier modules play a dual role as both producers and consumers,
acting as control units. These modules serve as pivotal points for communication, allowing the core
module to interact with them seamlessly.
We have developed dedicated simulated data producers to generate the requisite data inputs, mimicking
the behavior of real-world sensors and devices commonly found in smart home setups.
This system will execute appropriate actions in response to simulated real-world conditions, ultimately
yielding a smart home automation solution.
